# Localization tooling for Visual Studio Code

This repository contains tooling for localizing Visual Studio Code extensions. Localization for VS Code extension's source code has 4 important parts:

* [`vscode.l10n.t`](#vscodel10nt) - The API for translating strings in your extension's code
* [`@vscode/l10n-dev`](#vscodel10n-dev) - The tooling used for extracting l10n strings from vscode extensions and working with XLF files
* [`@vscode/l10n`](#vscodel10n) - The library used for loading the translations into subprocesses of your extension
* [`package.nls.json`](#packagenlsjson) - The file used for translating static contributions in your extension's `package.json`

Additionally, for a sample of how to use these tools, see the [l10n-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/l10n-sample) in the vscode-extension-samples repo.

## `vscode.l10n.t`

This API, introduced in VS Code 1.73, is used for translating strings in your extension's code. It is a part of the main VS Code extension API and is further documented [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#l10n).

> **Note**
>
> Make sure you your VS Code engine and `@types/vscode` version in your extension manifest is at least `^1.73.0`.

## `@vscode/l10n-dev`

Tooling used for extracting `l10n` strings from vscode extensions and working with XLF files. See it's dedicated [README](./l10n-dev) for usage instructions.

## `@vscode/l10n`

Library used for loading the translations into subprocesses of your extension. See it's dedicated [README](./l10n) for usage instructions.

> **Note**
>
> You should _NOT_ use this library in your extension's main process. The translations are loaded into the main process by VS Code itself.

## `package.nls.json`

This file, along with `package.nls.{locale}.json` files, are used for translating static contributions in your extension's `package.json`. Here's an example:

Your `./package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "./out/extension.js",
  "l10n": "./l10n",
  //...
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "my-extension.helloWorld",
        // The key is surrounded by % characters
        "title": "%my-extension.helloWorld.title%"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Your `./package.nls.json`:

```jsonc
{
  // That same key from the package.json
  "my-extension.helloWorld.title": "Hello World"
}
```

Your `./package.nls.de.json`:

```jsonc
{
  // That same key from the package.json
  "my-extension.helloWorld.title": "Hallo Welt"
}
```

VS Code will automatically load the correct `package.nls.{locale}.json` (or `package.nls.json` for English) file based on the locale of the user. If no translation is available for a given key, VS Code will fall back to the English translation.

> **Note**
>
> [@vscode/l10n-dev](#vscodel10n-dev) has some tooling around these files (converting them to XLIFF files, generating Pseudo-Localization files, etc.) that you can use.
